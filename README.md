# WeatherML
IoT-ML Weather Prediction System: Uses historical data (5 sites, 6 years) to train ML models (LSTM/Gradient Boosting) predicting daily weather. Simulated IoT device (Sense HAT emulator) displays forecasts vs. real-time data (temp, humidity, wind) with LED alerts for anomalies. Server hosts models, offers analytics for agriculture/urban planning.
